      question: "What is BMI and how is it calculated?",
      answer: "BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/mÂ²)."
    },
    {
      question: "Is BMI accurate for everyone?",
      answer: "BMI is a useful screening tool but has limitations. It doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat mass, so athletes or very muscular individuals may have high BMIs despite being healthy."
    },
    {
      question: "What BMI range is considered healthy?",
      answer: "A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally considered normal or healthy weight. However, optimal BMI can vary based on age, ethnicity, and individual factors."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I be concerned if my BMI is outside the normal range?",
      answer: "BMI outside the normal range may indicate health risks, but it's just one factor. Consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your overall health, body composition, and other risk factors."
