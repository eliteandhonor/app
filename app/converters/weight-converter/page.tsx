      question: "What's the difference between weight and mass?",
      answer: "Mass is the amount of matter in an object and doesn't change with location. Weight is the force of gravity on that mass and can vary with location. In everyday use, the terms are often used interchangeably."
    },

    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the weight conversions?",
